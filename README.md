Project : Yoga Posture Classification and Grading

Description :
With the growing popularity of home yoga, maintaining precise postures is essential to prevent injuries and maximize effectiveness. However, beginners often lack expert guidance.
This project aims to develop a yoga posture recognition model that can classify eight yoga poses from the static images. The long term goal is to extend this model for real time feedback and posture correction, helping users improve their alignment. The selected postures focus on back pain prevention and posture correction.
